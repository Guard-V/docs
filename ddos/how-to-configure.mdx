This guide will walk you through configuring DDoS protection for your infrastructure using Edge Rules and Application Filters. We'll cover best practices and step-by-step instructions for securing your services.

## Edge Rules Configuration

Edge Rules allow you to control traffic flows based on various criteria like IP addresses, protocols, and packet characteristics.

### Best Practice: Default Deny Rule

We strongly recommend starting with a "deny all" rule and then explicitly allowing only necessary traffic. Here's how to set this up:

<Note>
  Edge Rules use a dynamic priority system and follow a first-match principle. Rules are evaluated from highest priority (lowest number) 
  to lowest priority, and processing stops at the first matching rule. For example, if a packet matches a rule with priority 1, rules with 
  priority 2 and higher will not be evaluated. This makes rule priority crucial for proper traffic filtering.
  
  When creating a new rule, you can only assign a priority up to (highest existing priority + 1). If you insert a rule between existing 
  rules (e.g., adding a rule with priority 4), all subsequent rules will automatically shift down (the existing priority 4 becomes 5, 
  5 becomes 6, and so on). This helps maintain organized rule management while preventing priority gaps.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Default Deny Rule">
    1. Click "Create New Edge Rule"
    2. Select "ANY" for protocol
    3. Set Destination to your protected IP
    4. Set Source IP to "0.0.0.0/0" (all IPs)
    5. Set Priority to "1" (highest priority)
    6. Set Action to "Drop"
    7. Add description: "Drop All Traffic"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Allow Specific Services">
    Create subsequent rules with higher priority numbers to allow specific services:
    - Priority 1: Allow SSH (TCP port 22)
    - Priority 2: Allow HTTP/HTTPS (TCP ports 80/443)
    - Priority 3: Allow other required services
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Application Filters

Application Filters ensure only legitimate traffic of specific applications gets through and reach your server.

### Setting Up Application Filters

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Port Automation">
    Navigate to the Port Automation section in the dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Application Shield">
    Click "Create New Application Shield" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Application Settings">
    1. Enter your Destination IP
    2. Specify the Application Port
    3. Select the Application Type (e.g., FiveM, Wireguard, OpenVPN, Source Engine)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Configuration Tips

### Rate Limiting

When creating Edge Rules, consider setting appropriate rate limits, two types or rate limits are available:

- **Ratelimit**: This defines the maximum number of packets allowed per second (1-2500000 packets) per source IP. If the source IP exceeds this limit, the packet will be dropped.

- **Ratelimit Burst**: This setting allows for short bursts of traffic (1-250000 packets). It uses a token bucket algorithm, where tokens are added to a "bucket" at a fixed rate. Each packet sent removes a token. If the bucket is empty, additional packets are dropped. Each source IP has it's own "bucket".

### Feature Matching

Use Feature Matching to fine-tune your protection:
- **State Type**: Configure connection state matching
  - NEW: Match packets that start a new connection
  - ESTABLISHED: Match packets belonging to an existing connection
  - RELATED: Match packets related to, but not part of, an existing connection
  - INVALID: Match packets that don't belong to any known connection

- **Packet Length**: Set valid packet size ranges (1-65535 bytes)
  - Helps identify and filter abnormal packet sizes
  - Common legitimate packet sizes:
    - TCP packets: typically 40-1500 bytes
    - UDP gaming traffic: often 100-300 bytes
    - HTTP/HTTPS: variable, but usually under 1500 bytes
